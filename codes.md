## 1859 Western Union "92 Code"

The 92 Code was first adopted by Western Union in 1859. The reason for this adoption was to reduce bandwidth usage over the telegraph lines and speed transmissions by utilizing a numerical code system for various frequently used phrases.

The following code was taken from The Telegraph Instructor by G.M. Dodge.

### Contemporary usage
Today, amateur radio operators still use codes `73` and `88` profusely and `30` is used in journalism. Radio-amateurs also occasionally use the code `99` for "Go to Hell", though this may be their own addition to the code-table. The other codes have mostly fallen into disuse.


## Notes

If the duration of a dot is taken to be one unit then that of a dash is three units. The space between the components of one character is one unit, between characters is three units and between words seven units. To indicate that a mistake has been made and for the receiver to delete the last word, send ........ (eight dots).

The prosigns are combinations of two letters sent together with no space in between. The other abbreviations and Q codes are sent with the normal spacing.
